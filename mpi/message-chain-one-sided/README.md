## One-sided communication in message chain

Write a simple program where every MPI task communicates data with neighboring
tasks. Let *ntasks* be the number of the tasks, and *myid* the rank of the 
current process. Your program should work as follows:

 - Every task with a rank less than ntasks-1 sends a message to task myid+1.
   For example, task 0 sends a message to task 1.
 - The message content is an integer array where each element is initialized to
   myid.
 - The sender prints out the number of elements it sends
 - All tasks with rank â‰¥ 1 receive messages.
 - Each receiver prints out their myid, and the first element in the received
   array.

 1. Implement the program described above using MPI_Put
 2. Implement the program described above using MPI_Get
